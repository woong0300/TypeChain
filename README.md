# TypeChain
Blockchain prototype with TypeScript

With this project, I learn quite many things.

1.Don`t use enforced push by "git push origin +master".
this will destroy my .gitignore file, and README.md file. by doing that I have learn about importance of pushing with right way.

2.Importance of .gitignore file.
I do my project with nodeJS, typescript, tsc-watch...so I have many difficulties this time, when I write down many json files.
So I make a mistake that push everything about node_modules.

3.Difficulties of NodeJS and VScode settings.
This is first time to me to handle compile, run settings with package.json, tsconfig.json files. 
and It gives me a leeson that I have to study more about VScode and its settings. also It`s mistake to start this typescript project 
with any knowledge of NodeJS.

Anyway, I`ll finish this TypeChain project first, and next stduy about NodeJS, and json file settings more deeply as soon as possible.
